# Feature-Extraction-and-Modeling-ECG-Time-Series-Data
Compares feature-based ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) using time/frequency/time-frequency features with deep models (CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformer) on raw ECG data, showing feature-driven methods can rival state-of-the-art deep learning performance.
